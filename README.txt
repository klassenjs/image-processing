This is code I wrote for my Masters project.  It is related to extracting
3D point clouds from stereo pairs of digital aerial photos. The main program
is image3.cpp.  The rest represent various steps along the way.  This is
experimental code of dubious quality written to solve a very specific problem.

It is not well tested outside that situation and its use is not well
documented.  Use at your own risk.

As you can tell if you read the code, this depends heavily on OpenCV 2.4 and
GDAL 1.7+.
