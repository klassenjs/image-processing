1) Multiply all bands together
2) Mask out center of photo
3) Look for MAX value otherwise and report px location
4) -- maybe calculate the gradient too to verify?

3b) use 2D coorelation detector tuned for a point
   and record poistion of max response?

60% overlap means we expect to find the CPP about 10% from an edge

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0

So we can mask out the middle third (33% - 66%) to half (25% - 75%)
